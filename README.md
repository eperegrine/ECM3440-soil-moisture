Sensor
======

This repo is a sensor that can send data to the IOT Hub - It connect to CounterFit and pushes that data to the specified IOT Hub

## Setup

It is worth creating a virtualenv

### Virtualenv

https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

To create a venv run:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

For windows (powershell)
```powershell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
For Mac/Linux
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Requirements

Install dependencies by running 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Linting

The app is linted automatically by GH actions. The linting is done by pylint and can be run with: `pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')`

### Counter Fit

The sensor extracts data from counter fit, you can start this using

```bash
counterfit --port 3000
```

Make sure you are in the virtual env and have run the pip install

Then in counter fit you can setup the sensor

### Iot Hub

To create the device in the hub run:

```
az iot hub device-identity create --device-id soil-moisture-sensor --hub-name <hub_name>
```

Or to add a new device replace `soil-moisture-sensor` with the device name

The dashboard connects to the iot hubs built in event hub to receive messages from the sensor, you can  use this guide to get the connection details https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-samples-python/blob/master/iot-hub/Quickstarts/read-d2c-messages/Readme.md

And put the `SAS_KEY` in a `.env` file in the dashboard folder (or set it up as an environment variable)

## Startup

The following will help you setup the sensor to send data to the IoT Hub and have the dashboard receive it locally

First start counterfit `counterfit --port 3000`

For the sensor to start it needs a device connection string, if you have followed the previous instructions you should have a device in the IoT hub 
called `soil-moisture-sensor`. You can get the connection string by running:

```
az iot hub device-identity connection-string show --device-id soil-moisture-sensor --output table --hub-name <hub_name>
```

You will then need to put the connection string into the environemnt variables so the sensor can use it.

For Mac:

```
export SENSOR_CONN_STR='HostName=ecm3440-egp-hub.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=soil-moisture-sensor;SharedAccessKey=bOXsIlSVcMcfmK1wLwSnV1PHdV1mcg8sA+b8iRqOdk0='
```

For Windows

> TODO

Then you can run the sensor

```
python app.py
```

Then in counter fit you can setup the sensor

### How to build and run the dashboard container

Pre-requisite:  You need to know the name of the docker hub repo where this image should be pushed to or ask a team member for this information.  Do a ``` docker login ``` to login to docker.

To build the dashboard container, run the command below:
`docker build . -t $(REPO_NAME)/python-dashboard:latest`

To run the dashboard container, run the command below:
`docker run -p 127.0.0.1:5001:5001 python-dashboard:latest`

To push to the hub, the command is:
`docker push $(REPO_NAME)/python-dashboard:latest`
